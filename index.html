      <h1>Hello, I'm Carlos</h1>
      <p>
        I am a student of Web Development at CodeFellows. I served in the Navy
        for 5 years as a radar altimeter technician in the avionics department
        on board an LHD(amphibious ship). I have some college credits including
        general studies and introductory engineering courses. My initial goal
        was to use the GI Bill to study industrial engineering but have found
        myself more interested in the tech industry. I plan on becoming a junior
        web developer after CodeFellows, continuing to gain professional
        knowledge and experience -especially new languages like python, and
        potentially pursuing my bachelors degree in a computer related subject.
