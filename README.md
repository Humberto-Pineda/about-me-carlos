## About Me

This web page is a rudimentary 5-questions game that gives that greets and introduces myself to the user. The goal is to demonstrate my abilities in developing simple web pages utilizing HTML, CSS, and JS.

<!-- My name is Carlos and I am a student of Web Development at CodeFellows. I served in the Navy for 5 years as a radar altimeter technician in the avionics department on board an LHD. I have some college credits including general studies and introductory engineering courses. My initial goal was to use the GI Bill to study industrial engineering but have found myself more interested in the tech industry. I plan on becoming a junior web developer after CodeFellows, continue to professionally learn and grow -especially new languages like python, and potentially pursue my bachelors degree in a computer related subject. -->
